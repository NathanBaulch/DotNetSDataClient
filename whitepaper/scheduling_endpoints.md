The Sage Job Server enables you to schedule single and recurring tasks for immediate or
delayed execution, either manually or dynamically at run time. It executes tasks out of process,
freeing up worker threads and memory for client sessions. For more information about the
Sage Job Server, see the "An Introduction to Job Server In Sage SalesLogix" whitepaper.
